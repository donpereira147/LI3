# LI3

Computer Labs 3

This assignment consisted of reading files of 1,2 and 5 million lines of a file, parse those lines and store them in correct structures. The first part of the assignment was executed in C and the second one was executed in JAVA. 

The main focus of the assignment was to program with everything encapsulated and protected, so that one should only look at the header files (in C) to realize what the code was about.

The second part of the assignment (in JAVA) included a testing part, where one should change the data structures (for exemple, if you used an ArrayList, you should change to a LinkedList), in order to conclude which of them were faster to iterate through.
